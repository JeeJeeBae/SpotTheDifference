# Technologies Used: 

JavaScript, HTM & CSS were used to create this game.

# Getting Started:

**Play the game [HERE](https://jeejeebae.github.io/SpotTheDifference/).**

# Next Steps: 

- Create a button/section to show correct spots if the player fails to find all answers before the timer ends.
- Refine the click/selection area so that multiple "boxes" could be selected for one spot and change the correct answer display to a circle.
- Create different levels by adding/reducing time and adding more difficult images. 
- Make it a two-player game.
- Add sound effects to make the game more interactive.
- When all boards are played, display final scores and provide the ability to start over again if wanted.
